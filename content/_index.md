## Who we are

Northern Exposure Saunas is owned and run by portage county locals Jake Damask and Isaac Trzebiatowski. What started as just a desire to enjoy health benefits and some polar plunges turned into a business idea.

Over the past few years, the sauna has been enjoyed by family and friends. We have always wanted to reach more people so others are able to enjoy the benefits and joy from the sauna experience without having to purchase everything on your own. Northern exposure saunas allows you to have a stress free, hassle free, sauna experience delivered right to your door step.

## Benefits

1. **Detoxification**: Saunas can help in flushing out toxins from the body through increased sweating.
2. **Improved Circulation**: The heat from the sauna expands blood vessels, leading to better blood flow.
3. **Muscle Relaxation**: The warmth helps to relax muscles and alleviate tension, aiding in recovery from physical exertion.
4. **Stress Reduction**: Sauna use promotes relaxation and can reduce stress levels, contributing to overall mental well-being.
5. **Pain Relief**: Heat therapy can alleviate pain from conditions such as arthritis, muscle soreness, and headaches.
6. **Skin Cleansing**: Sweating opens pores and helps cleanse the outer skin, potentially improving skin health.
7. **Improved Sleep**: Regular sauna use is associated with better sleep quality, likely due to its relaxing effects.
8. **Immune System Boost**: Regular sauna sessions can stimulate the production of white blood cells, potentially boosting the immune system.
9. **Cardiovascular Health**: Regular sauna use may improve heart function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
10. **Respiratory Benefits**: The warm, moist air of a steam sauna can help clear congestion and improve breathing for those with certain respiratory conditions.
